# simplelinux

A simple, source-based Linux distribution inspired by Arch Linux and Linux From Scratch.

## Philosophy

1.  **Simplicity:** The entire system should be transparent to the user. The build process for every package is a simple, readable shell script.
2.  **Minimalism:** The base system contains only the essential tools to get a working command line.
3.  **Source-Based:** All packages are compiled directly from source code.
4.  **User-Centric:** The user has full control over their system.
